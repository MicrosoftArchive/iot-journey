1. Run Provision-All using Windows Azure PowerShell

1. In the Windows Azure portal, open the stream analytics job fabrikamstreamjob01, and test the connections for input01, input02, output01, and output02

1. Upload fabrikam_buildingdevice.json to the container01refdata of the storage account and rename it as as fabrikam/buildingdevice.json

1. Update the mysettings.config file - set the Simulator.EventHubConnectionString and Simulator.EventHubPath with the values for the newly provisioned event hub.

1. Start the Stream Analytics Job
