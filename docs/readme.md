# Navigating the Docs

_If you want to understand the intent of this project as well as some of the basic terms we'll be using, be sure to read the [readme file](../README.md) in the root of the repo._

The documentation for this project is organized as follows:

1. :notebook: The [journal](journal) folder contains _journal entries_ that chronicle our efforts as we build the system described in our [scenario][]. The entries will align with the project's [milestones][]. They are episodes in a larger story.
They will discuss:
    - The goals for the milestone.
    - The challenges we faced while pursuing the goals.
    - The implementation decisions we made based on our scenario.
    - The consequences of our implementation decisions.
    - References to supporting materials to help you make implementation
    decisions appropriate to your scenarios.
1. :newspaper: The [articles](articles) folder contains stand-alone articles that are on various topics. These articles will be broadly applicable to architecting and building an IoT solution. We will often reference the articles as supporting material for the choices we make on our journey, but they are largely independent from our [scenario][].
1. :blue_book: The [reference](reference) folder is additional supporting documentation. It differs from the articles in that it is a place to look up information and not intended to be read in whole.

The documents in this folder are specifically about defining the project as a whole. They can be read in any order.
