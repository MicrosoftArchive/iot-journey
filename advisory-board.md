# Advisory Board

Guidance is harvested from experience and matured through dialog. 
An essential component for projects in p&p is our _advisory boards_. 
We value diversity in our boards, which include both Microsoft employees and members from the community at large. 
We like subject matter experts and passionate novices. 
We want advisors that can represent common interests across a wide variety of industries.

## What does the project hope to gain from an advisory board?

Advisors help us to set priorities for the project.
They provide real-time feedback about the guidance we are creating.
We also benefit when our advisors engage their respective communities about the project in order to collect an even broader set of feedback.
Our ultimate goal is produce practical guidance for real world development problems.

_One critical contribution is helping us to identify the most common challenges that engineering teams face when building IoT solutions._

## How much time will advisors spend on our project?

Every other week, we host an online meeting that lasts about an hour. 
During this meeting, we demonstrate what we’ve done since the last meeting. 
We discuss how we did the work and why we did it. 
We solicit feedback during these meetings and we encourage a critical (though friendly) evaluation of everything we do.

We also ask our advisors to examine our work in between these regular meetings. 
This involves reviewing the code and commenting on content. 
It helps the meetings to be more productive.

## What do the advisors get out of it?

Our advisory board is voluntary. 
However, it’s a great place to share experiences and learn from others. 
It’s also a good way to meet other people who are passionate and thoughtful. 

We make it a point to acknowledge each of our contributing advisors when the guidance is published. 
Also, former advisors have expressed personal value in showing their involvement in helping Microsoft shape guidance in a specific area. 

## What are the qualifications for being an advisor?

First, an advisor needs to care about the Internet of Things and related topics. 
Secondly, they need to be willing to participate in the feedback process. 
With respect to technical knowledge, both _real world experience_ 
or the _need to be successful in the near future_ are good qualities to bring to the table.
