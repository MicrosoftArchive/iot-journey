> Note: These steps are a brief overview. For detailed instructions on building and provisioning the sample solution, see ![Building and Running the IoT Sample Solution](/docs/building-and-deploying-the-sample-solution.md)

1. Build the solution to download the Nuget packages (the build process will report that the file mysettings.config is missing).

1. Run `Provision-All` using Azure PowerShell.

1. Verify that `fabrikam/buildingdevice.json` is uploaded to  `blobs-asa-refdata` of the storage account.

1. In the Azure portal, open the Stream Analytics job `[YourApplicationName]ToBlob`, and test the connections for `input01` and `output01`.

1. In the Azure portal, open the Stream Analytics job `[YourApplicationName]ToSql`, and test the connections for `input01`, `input02`, and `output01`.

1. Start the Stream Analytics jobs.
