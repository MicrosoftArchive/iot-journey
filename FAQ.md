# FAQ

1. What is this project about?

  _Start with the [readme](README.md)._

1. Are you planning to build an IoT library? Will there be a set of reusable
bits or a framework that I use to build my solution?

  _No, we do not intend to produce any NuGet packages, assemblies, or services
  as part of this project._

1. If this is an IoT project, why is the focus on the backend services and not
so much about devices?

  _In many way, an IoT solution is all about the data. Devices on the edge
produce the data. Backend services ingest, process, and analyze the data. Our
initial focus in this project is on the ingestion and processing of the data.
These are parts of the solution that can be hosted on Azure._

1. Is this guidance _just_ for .NET developers? 

  _Our team's skills are primarily in .NET. 
  However, Microsoft Azure is an open platform and we want to make everything we do accessible to a broad audience.
  Even though we often start with .NET, we plan to implement some solutions in Java, and possibly even Node JS.
  We would love to see contributions from the community implementing some aspects of this guidance on different platforms._

1. I haven't seen any activity on this project for some number of days? Does
that mean it's dead?

  _From time to time we'll let this guidance hibernate while we work on other
things. As new technologies and services become available, we'll rouse the
project and continue the effort. We will keep the status updated on this repo so
you can know what to expect._
